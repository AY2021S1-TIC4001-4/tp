## Project: NUS Expenses Tracker (NET)
NET is an app for managing expenses, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

### Contributions to the project.

* New Feature: Added the ability to view total expenses.
([#17](https://github.com/AY2021S1-TIC4001-4/tp/pull/17)).
  * What it does: Allows the user to see their total expenses made so far  
  * Justification: This feature is the highlight of the product because other than keying the expenses, user would also wish to see the total expense so far. 
  
* New Feature: Added the storage ability to load and save expenses.
([#35](https://github.com/AY2021S1-TIC4001-4/tp/pull/35)).
  * What it does: Allow the user to keep all the expenses record they have when they use the systems. 
  * Justification: This feature consider the core feature because persistence storage is important for user to maintain all their expenses through out the daily usage. 
  * Credits: Logic and design adapted from addressbook-level2 ([Storage](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level2/tree/master/src/seedu/addressbook/storage))
